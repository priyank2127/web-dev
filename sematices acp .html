                Domestication is a multi-generational mutualistic relationship in which an animal species, such as humans or leafcutter
                ants, takes over control and care of another species, such as sheep or fungi, to obtain from them a steady supply of
                resources, such as meat, milk, or labor. The process is gradual and geographically diffuse, based on trial and error.
                Domestication affected genes for behavior in animals, making them less aggressive. In plants, domestication affected
                genes for morphology, such as increasing seed size and stopping the shattering of cereal seedheads. Such changes both
                make domesticated organisms easier to handle and reduce their ability to survive in the wild.

                he domestication of plants began around 13,000â€“11,000 years ago with cereals such as wheat and barley in the Middle
                East, alongside crops such as lentil, pea, chickpea, and flax. Beginning around 10,000 years ago, Indigenous peoples in
                the Americas began to cultivate peanuts, squash, maize, potatoes, cotton, and cassava. Rice was first domesticated in
                China some 9,000 years ago. In Africa, crops such as sorghum were domesticated. Agriculture developed in some 13 centres
                around the world, domesticating different crops and animals.
