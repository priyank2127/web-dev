    <p>High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used
    by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles
    (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy
    games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has
    filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and
    common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."[2][3]</p>

        <p>Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field's long-term goals.[4] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[5]</p>
