        <h1>Cricket </h1>is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of<mark> eleven players </mark>on a field, at the centre of which is a <pre>22-yard pitch</pre> with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three
        stumps.Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats,
        while one player from the fielding and bowling team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of
        the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with
        the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of
        the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.
